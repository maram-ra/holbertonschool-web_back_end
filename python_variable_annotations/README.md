# Python - Variable Annotations

This project focuses on learning and practicing **type annotations** in Python 3. Youâ€™ll use typing hints to define function signatures, variable types, and more â€” preparing your code for better readability, tooling, and error detection.

##  Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Understand and apply **Duck Typing**
- Validate annotated Python code using `mypy`
- Understand the benefit of explicit typing in large codebases

## ðŸ“„ Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Code style: pycodestyle (version 2.5.*)
- All files are executable and have documentation
- All files must end with a new line

## Tasks Overview

| Task | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `0-add.py` | Type-annotated function to add two floats |
| 1 | `1-concat.py` | Concatenate two strings with annotations |
| 2 | `2-floor.py` | Return floor of a float as an int |
| 3 | `3-to_str.py` | Convert float to string with annotation |
| 4 | `4-define_variables.py` | Define annotated variables of various types |
| 5 | `5-sum_list.py` | Sum a list of floats |
| 6 | `6-sum_mixed_list.py` | Sum a list of integers and floats |
| 7 | `7-to_kv.py` | Return a tuple with a string and squared number |
| 8 | `8-make_multiplier.py` | Return a function that multiplies a float |
| 9 | `9-element_length.py` | Annotate a function using iterable duck typing |
